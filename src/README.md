## Objectives

- Practical knowledge of HTML, CSS, Java, Selenium, API Testing
- Theoretical knowledge of the fundamental concepts of programming
- General knowledge of computer hardware, networking, and professional programming
- Habits and skills that enable programming - source control, testing, debugging, etc
- Communication skills, the ability to explain complex technical concepts in simple terms

## Intro

### What is programming?

A program is a series of instructions given to a computer which perform operations on data, transforming input into output. We write our instructions, or 'source code' in text files, then 'run' those instructions

### Why Java?

- It is a stable, proven, in-demand language
- It has a wide variety of libraries and resources
- It can be used for large-scale, multi-tiered, reliable and secure network applications

## Course Overview

This course is a kick-start to learning test automation, it is immersive and pragmatic. We learn by doing, and focus on understanding the principles of programming practice. Most of the class time will consist of lectures, assignments and projects.

## Healthy Habits

* Commit and push labs to Github every day for attendance. You are not graded on unfinished labs.
* Ask for help if you're stuck, or if you don't understand a topic. Ask your instructor.
* When faced with a new problem:
* Ask for help from your instructor.
* Utilize study hall.
* When you get an error:
  read the error message carefully
  look at where in the code it points to
  google the error message if it's specific
* When you get stuck:
  take a step back, re-evaluate the problem context
  look at previous labs
* Utilize w3schools and youtube
  look for similar examples on stack overflow
  try extracting bits of code and running them in isolation
  ask a fellow student, TA, or instructor
* Avoid getting burnt-out:
  take regular breaks


## Exercises

### Lectures & Demonstrations

The purpose of lectures is to introduce and explain a topic. Most lectures are followed by live demonstrations. Please do not distract yourself during lecture. These will be recorded and posted after class.

### Labs

Please label your labs/solutions very clearly (`lab01.java`, `lab02.java`) so you don’t get confused.

The labs are designed for students to interact with each other and brainstorm together and to come up with ideas and solutions.

Make an honest attempt before you ask for help on a lab. Look carefully at the error message and where in the code it's occurring. Look through the provided resources, look at previous labs, research the problem on google and stack overflow. If you're stuck after reviewing and researching, please ask for help, either from another student, a TA, or the instructor.

### Student Presentations

Weekly, a different student presents a topic.

These presentations help you practice communicating technical topics in English. Being able to speak intelligently about programming is almost as important as programming itself. This skill will allow you to better talk to interviewers, managers, clients, coworkers, and more.


## Rough Timeline

- Week 1-2: HTML + CSS
- Week 3-11: Java, Soft Skills, Git
- Week 12-16: Selenium/TestNG, Cucumber
- Week 17-18: DataBase Testing/JDBC
- Week 19-20: API Testing
- Week 21: Mobile Testing
- Week 22: Mock Interview

## Code of Conduct

At RenasTech we seek to create an environment conducive to personal and professional growth. Academic and personal integrity are central to creating such an environment.

## Academic Progress

Do not look at the solution or other students' solutions until you've finished the lab yourself.

You are encouraged to use resources (docs, online, books, each other) to research solutions. If you copy code from the internet or a book, you must understand what it means and how it works.

## Attendance

Students are expected to be on time and attend all scheduled class times. The school requires ninety percent (90%) completion of class hours in order to receive a certificate of completion from the course. Students can miss no more than 7 days of class. Students can also not be absent for more than 5 days consecutively (this includes weekends).

## Refund

A student’s account is reviewed after 5 days from payment due date.  Accounts that remain unpaid or have not established a Repayment Agreement through our billing cycle will be issued a Final Notice.  Upon Final Notice students will be revoked from classes and no refunds will be issued.  Failure to maintain payments under the Repayment Agreement will result in an account being sent to collections.
